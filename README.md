# Modal Project

This is a simple project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate the usage of DOM manipulation and various event listeners. In this project, we have created a basic modal that can be opened and closed by clicking on a button. This is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn about how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) and handle user interactions with JavaScript.
